Background As a data analyst, I spend a lot of time on my computer at the office. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the best view of the outside world from my cubicle. In fact, they have decided to put us analysts in the basement where we can&amp;rsquo;t even see the sun!</description>

      <description>Lets build something together My name is Stuart. I solve problems using data. I currently work within the Business Intelligence division of a consumer packaged goods company, with previous experience as a portfolio analyst for a wealth management firm.
This site is a collection of my thoughts, projects and interests. I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated by the open source community, and all that can be learned/built from it. I try to work with open source tools such as R as much as I can, and in the spirit of collaboration, share what I learn along the way.</description>
